## About the Project

Reglyph is not a commercial product.  
It is an open-source initiative driven by the desire to:

- create a solid and thoughtfully designed UI system;
- explore and develop solutions in an underrepresented direction of web development;
- gain real-world experience building a complex, reusable design system from scratch;
- showcase our skills and approach to potential employers.

The project is fully open-source and distributed under the **MIT license**.
